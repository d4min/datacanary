# DataCanary 

DataCanary is an open-source data quality toolkit I built to showcase my data engineering expertise. It helps identify quality issues through statistical profiling and applies validation rules across various cloud storage providers. The project demonstrates my approach to preventing data problems through pattern detection and custom rule enginesâ€”all backed by clean, well-documented code that reflects production-grade engineering principles.

## Current Features

- file validation for CSV and JSON formats.
- basic data quality checks (types, nulls, dates, patterns).
- CLI tool for running validations.
- custom rule configuration via JSON files.
- validation reporting with error messages.
- cloud storage connectors:
    - AWS S3
    - Azure Blob Storage
    - Google Cloud Storage
